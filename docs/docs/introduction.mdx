# Introduction
This webpage serves as the documentation for **modOpt** - a modular development environment and library optimizers.

ModOpt is primarily developed for **easy and fast** development of gradient-based optimization algorithms through modular construction of algorithms
and testing with built-in problems and interfaces with test-suites.

**Benchmarking** with built-in standard algorithms or interfaced external optimizer libraries are also possible.

**Custom optimization algorithms** can be developed in a modular fashion using the **Optimizer()** class in modOpt.

**Custom optimization problems** to be solved with any of the optimizers available can be written using the **Problem()** class in modOpt.
Optimization problems written in [csdl](https://lsdolab.github.io/csdl/) modeling language is also supported.
